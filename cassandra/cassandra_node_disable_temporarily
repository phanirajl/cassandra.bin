# Use nodetool to disable Cassandra only on a specific node.
# from: http://www.jointhegrid.com/highperfcassandra/?cat=10

# There are times when you would like a Cassandra node to stop receiving requests or appear like it is down to outside clients.
# You may want to use this to disable a node and adjust your log4j properties for more debugging,
# or your may be running some administrative action like repair or rebuildsstables and you want this action to complete as quickly as possible. 
# Being able to disable Cassandra without shutting it down completely can be very handy.

# How it works:
# Gossip is the protocol that Cassandra nodes use to determine which nodes are UP or DOWN.
# Cassandra nodes gossip to each other and maintain a state of the cluster.
# By disabling gossip other Cassandra nodes will stop forwarding read and write requests to this node 
# because they will believe the node is down. Client using thrift will still be able to connect to a node in this state.
# Disablethrift disables the client port 9160 which prevents clients from connecting to this node. 
# Typically you will enable both disablethrift and disablegossip together.

trace_cmd=true
cassandra_nodetool disablegossip "$@"
cassandra_nodetool disablethrift "$@"

# warning: add disabling streaming and binary protocol
